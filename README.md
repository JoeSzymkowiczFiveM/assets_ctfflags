## Description
This resource adds the custom texture flag props to FiveM, that are used in the Capture The Flag resource I made.

## Features
* Flags with collision.
* Model names are `ctfredflag` and `ctfblueflag`.
* I modified the embedded texture on the flag to make them red and blue, but you can change them to whatever you need with OpenIV, following this [guide](https://forums.gta5-mods.com/topic/7173/can-you-modify-embedded-textures-in-a-ydr/2).

## Credit

## Description
This resource adds the custom texture flag props to FiveM, that are used in the Capture The Flag resource I made. Add this resource to your FiveM server and ensure/start it in the server.cfg.

It's a dependency of the [js5m-ctf](https://github.com/JoeSzymkowiczFiveM/js5m-ctf) FiveM script.

## Features
* Flags with collision.
* Model names are `ctfredflag` and `ctfblueflag`.
* I modified the embedded texture on the flag to make them red and blue, but you can change them to whatever you need with OpenIV, following this [guide](https://forums.gta5-mods.com/topic/7173/can-you-modify-embedded-textures-in-a-ydr/2).

## Credit
- [TayMcKenzieNZ](https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/rpemotes) for the flag models that I used as a base for these.
